# Distend
> generate targeted word lists for password cracking

![](https://github.com/not-sponsored/distend/blob/main/example_usage.gif)

Perhaps you have a stubborn hash that refuses to crack under a generic word list. Maybe you have specific intelligence about the person/password in question such as a

- Date of birth
- Mother's maiden name
- Pet names
- Age
- Address
- Other important dates
- Business specific terms
- Favorite foods
- Catch phrases
- Etc

Why not combine the generic word list with the extra details for a more targeted list?

Distend can do that for you. It can even implement common leet speak character replacements.

Implemented with generators, Distend is memory efficient even on large word lists, and it may be a faster alternative to brute forcing on certain hash formats.
