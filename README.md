# Distend
> generate targeted word lists for password cracking

![](https://github.com/not-sponsored/distend/blob/main/example_usage.gif)

Perhaps you have a stubborn hash that refuses to crack under a generic word list. Maybe you have specific intel about the person/password in question such as a

- Date of birth
- Mother's maiden name
- Pet names
- Age
- Address
- Other important dates
- Business specific terms
- Favorite foods
- Catch phrases
- Etc

Why not combine the generic word list with the extra details for a more targeted list?

If you think that's a good idea, then Distend is for you. It can even implement common leet speak character replacements.
