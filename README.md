# Distend
> generate targeted word lists for password cracking

![](https://github.com/not-sponsored/distend/blob/feature/example_usage.gif)

Psst. Hey there kid. I got a free word list generator that makes cracking a breeze. All you have to do is star the repository. Just kidding but the free part is not a joke. Perhaps you have a stubborn hash that refuses to crack under a generic word list. Maybe you have specific intel about the person/password in question such as a

- Date of birth
- Mother's maiden name
- Pet names
- Age
- Address
- Other important dates
- Business specific terms
- Favorite foods
- Catch phrases
- Etc

Why not combine the generic word list with the extra details for a more targeted list?

If you think that's a good idea, then Distend is for you. It can even implement common leet speak character replacements.

## Installation

You can install the package from PyPi using pip

```sh
pip install distend
```

or you can directly clone the repository then install locally

```sh
git clone [url_from_code_button_above]
cd [your_clone_location]
pip install .
```

Distend is supported on Python 3.6 and above. Also, there are no dependencies, but Distend does use a few standard library packages (included by default with your Python install).

## Usage

Basic Usage

```sh

```

For more details and options use the help flag

-----
## Development setup

To run the unit tests, navigate to the test directory and run the following

```sh
python3 -m unittest test_modifier.py
python3 -m unittest test_io_utils.py

You may have to visit the repository to get the test files because they are not included with the pip install.
